In this case, \r\n1.        What can they use as grounds to convince the clan elders? Opio and Achieng can inform the clan that the law does not discriminate between children born in and outside the marriage and that they are all entitled to the property. \r\n2.        Are there any structures at district level? \r\n3.        Where is the Administrator General\u2019s office/representative at district level? What do they need to go to the Administrator General\r\n4.        If that fails, then the children can report the matter to the office of the Administrator General who will then be able to offer them more assistance. \r\n\r\n**Possible Solutions:**\r\n\r\n 1. The first step to take would be to call for a family meeting to try and resolve this issue.\r\n 2. If the family meeting fails to resolve this issue, then the next step would be to report the matter to the office of the Administrator General, or a representative of this office at the district level. \r\n 3. If the above two options fail, then the final alternative is to proceed with this issue to court.",
