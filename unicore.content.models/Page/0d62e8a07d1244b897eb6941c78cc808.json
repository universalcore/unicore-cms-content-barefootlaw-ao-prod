At the beginning of this year, my mother\u2019s sister brought me to Kampala to work. I work as a house girl. My work starts at 5am and doesn\u2019t end until midnight. I am paid 20,000 shillings every month.I don\u2019t even go to school.\r\n\r\n**What the Law Says:**\r\n\r\n 1. Under the Ugandan law, a child is anyone under 18 years of age.  \r\n    \r\n 2. The Law does not prevent children from being employed or working but\r\n    rather prohibits the type of work children can be engaged in. \r\n\r\n 3. Children below 12 years old cannot be employed. However, the law\r\n    allows children between 12-14 years to do light work. Children below\r\n    16 years cannot do work underground, such as mining, or dangerous\r\n    work that is harmful to their health. \r\n\r\n 4. It is unlawful to employ children to work anytime between 7pm to 7am.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n**Possible Solutions:**\t\t\r\n\r\n 1. Juliet can start by calling the child helpline on 116\r\n 2. Juliet can report this matter to the nearest police station or the child welfare officer for that area.\r\n 3. She could also report the circumstances under which she is treated to relatives in the village  in order to try and resolve her situation as a family.\r\n 4. Contact the nearest LC official\r\n 5.
